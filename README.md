# Blockchain-in-python-and-flask
Features:


Create a new blockchain: Initializes a new blockchain with a genesis block and sets up the initial state.

Add new transactions to the blockchain: Records new transactions into the current block for subsequent validation and inclusion in the blockchain.

Mine new blocks: Computes the proof of work for a new block, adding it to the blockchain upon successful validation.

Register new nodes: Enlists new network nodes to participate in the blockchain network for decentralized consensus.

Resolve conflicts between nodes (Consensus): Resolves discrepancies in the blockchain across nodes to achieve a consistent and agreed-upon state.

Smart Contracts: Utilize self-executing contracts with programmable terms to automate transactions based on predefined conditions, boosting efficiency and trust in agreements.


Wallet System: Implement a secure storage solution for users to manage their digital assets, employing private and public key cryptography to enable secure transactions.


Interactivity with Real-World Applications: Develop an API that allows seamless integration between your blockchain and external applications, enabling functionalities like document verification or a transparent voting system.


Consensus Algorithms: Integrate various consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), or Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), to ensure agreement and reliable validation of transactions, each with its unique benefits in terms of security, speed, and energy efficiency.


Peer-to-Peer Network: Establish a decentralized network where multiple nodes collaborate to maintain the blockchain, enhancing system resilience, transparency, and eliminating the need for a central authority.


Enhanced Security Measures: Strengthen the security of the blockchain by implementing measures like two-factor authentication, safeguarding user wallets and the integrity of transactions.


Tokenization: Enable the creation of tokens on the blockchain, representing real-world assets or functioning as a native cryptocurrency, facilitating value exchange and expanding the range of potential applications.


Scalability Solutions: Implement scalability solutions such as sharding or off-chain transactions to overcome performance limitations, ensuring the blockchain can accommodate a growing number of users and transactions while maintaining efficiency.




HOW TO RUN:


AFTER your flask socket io server starts running:



Open Postman:

If you don't have Postman installed, you can download it from the Postman website.
Create a New Request:

Click the + button next to the Request tab or select New from the top left corner and then Request.
Set the Method:

On the top left of the new request tab, you'll see a dropdown menu that defaults to GET. Click this dropdown menu to select the HTTP method you need (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
Enter the Request URL:

In the field next to the method dropdown, enter the URL for your endpoint. For example, http://localhost:5000/mine.
Set Headers (if needed):

For some requests, especially POST requests, you might need to set headers. Click the Headers tab below the URL field and add the necessary headers. For example, to specify the content type for a POST request, you might add:
Key: Content-Type
Value: application/json

Create a New Wallet
Endpoint: /wallet/new

Method: GET
Steps:

Open Postman.
Create a new request.
Set the method to GET and the URL to http://localhost:5000/wallet/new.
Send the request.
You should receive a response with a new private and public key.

. Create a New Transaction
Endpoint: /transactions/new

Method: POST
Steps:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the method to POST and the URL to http://localhost:5000/transactions/new.
Go to the Body tab, select raw, and set the format to JSON.
{
    "sender": "<public_key_of_sender>",
    "recipient": "<public_key_of_recipient>",
    "amount": 10,
    "signature": "<signature>"
}
Replace <public_key_of_sender> with the public key from the wallet you created.
Replace <public_key_of_recipient> with another public key or the same public key for testing.
To get the signature, use the /transaction/sign endpoint.

Sign a Transaction
Endpoint: /transaction/sign

Method: POST
Steps:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the method to POST and the URL to http://localhost:5000/transaction/sign.
Go to the Body tab, select raw, and set the format to JSON.
{
    "private_key": "<private_key>",
    "transaction": {
        "sender": "<public_key_of_sender>",
        "recipient": "<public_key_of_recipient>",
        "amount": 10
    }
}
Replace <private_key> with the private key from the wallet you created.
Replace <public_key_of_sender> and <public_key_of_recipient> with the appropriate public keys.
Send the request.
Copy the signature from the response and use it in the /transactions/new request.

Mine a New Block
Endpoint: /mine

Method: GET
Steps:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the method to GET and the URL to http://localhost:5000/mine.
Send the request.
You should receive a response indicating a new block has been forged.

 Get the Full Blockchain
Endpoint: /chain

Method: GET
Steps:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the method to GET and the URL to http://localhost:5000/chain.
Send the request.
You should receive a response with the entire blockchain.

Register a Node
Endpoint: /nodes/register

Method: POST
Steps:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the method to POST and the URL to http://localhost:5000/nodes/register.
Go to the Body tab, select raw, and set the format to JSON.
{
    "nodes": ["http://localhost:5001"]
}
Send the request.
You should receive a response indicating the nodes have been added.


Resolve Conflicts
Endpoint: /nodes/resolve

Method: GET
Steps:

In Postman, create a new request.
Set the method to GET and the URL to http://localhost:5000/nodes/resolve.
